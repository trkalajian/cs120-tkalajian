1.  Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
    It seems everything is implemented as asked.
2.  Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.
    No one.
3.  Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.
    About 2 hours.
4.  For this lab, show the impact of performance enhancements. Provide a comparison of the performance of page with vs without optimizations. At bare minimum, provide load times and file sizes.
    Before the optimizations the load time was about 483ms and required making about 74 requests, but after the optimizations it only took about 283ms and made 19 requests.  The stylesheet is about 200 bytes smaller and the javascrypt is about 500 bytes smaller.
